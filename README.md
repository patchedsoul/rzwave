# Z-Wave

The `zwave` crate allows Rust programs to control Z-Wave networks. It's a work-in-progress. In it's
current state, it can control the brightness of a light bulb, and that's about it. Feel free to
[open an issue](https://gitlab.com/dcuddeback/zwave/issues) to give input on which features are
implemented next.
